                Hi! I am Olha, also you can call me Olia. I am a front-end developer. My interest in Frontend development has been with me for many years. 
                I made my first website when I was very young and learned the basics myself. The website was pretty simple, containing HTML and some CSS. 
                But it brings to my mind warm feelings because I did everything by myself: design, code, content (photos, texts). It was a huge job for me, 
                but I coped with it. Unfortunately, I lost this website. There is a slight possibility that I would show it to the public, but it would be k
                ind of my memento thing.
                So one day, I decided to go this route, which is imaginative and captivating. And I want to develop, learn and create more in this field. 
                I have a lot of things to get to know, to experience. I am just at the beginning, and I hope that my path will be productive and inspiring. 
            
                <h2>A few words about my education</h2>
                I studied at Odesa National Polytechnic University in Ukraine.
                I've got a master's degree in Computer systems and networks and a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. So as you see, I have technical education, 
                but it wasn't close to the frontend. 
                But when I decided to go that route, I completed the Frontend course that included learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, TypeScript, and a little 
                bit of Angular. After graduation, I continue learning things on my own (educational websites, videos, courses). I represent some projects on this website. 
                You can check them out in Projects. 
                
                <h2>A few words about my career</h2>
                People, like me, are called "switchers" because we have changed our careers. There was a time when I was a tester. I wrote test cases for testing software 
                for aviation and manufacturing. Then, I was an agent and worked mainly in customer service at a telecommunications company. I stayed there for a long time 
                and got a promotion. So after that, I was a manager in the marketing department. And last but not least: I worked as a manager in an educational company, 
                where I was also involved in customer service and marketing solutions. As a front-end developer, I have just started my career. I was involved in the 
                development of the website for my friend's startup. I did little, but because of the non-disclosure policy, I am not allowed to say too much.

                <h2>A few words about my personality</h2>
                What marks me out is my responsibility, ability to learn and communicate.
	            And as an ordinary person, I am interested in reading, watching movies, TV series, anime, making some digital pictures for personal pleasure.
